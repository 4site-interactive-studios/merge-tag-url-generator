2. Any custom merge tags on the page should automatically generate.

3. As you enter the merge tag data, the page preview will update to reflect your changes. To view the page without the merge tag data, you can select the `Without Merge Tags` option above the preview.

4. At the bottom of the page you'll find the generated URL with the merge tag data that you have entered. It also automatically updates to reflect the merge tag data you enter. You can copy it to your clipboard by clicking the `Copy to clipboard` option.
