# merge-tag-url-generator

URL Generator that fills in merge tags for EN donation pages

## How to use
1. Enter the URL of the page you'd like to preview into the first input box as shown below:

2. If the custom merge tags don't automatically generate, you can manually add them using the `Add Merge Tag` button.

3. As you enter the merge tag data, the page preview will update to reflect your changes. To view the page without the merge tag data, you can select the `Without Merge Tags` option above the preview.

4. At the bottom of the page you'll find the generated URL with the merge tag data that you have entered. It also automatically updates to reflect the merge tag data you enter. You can copy it to your clipboard by clicking the `Copy to clipboard` option.
